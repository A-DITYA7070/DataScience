 Intro to Statatics :-

=> statatics is the science of collecting,organising and analyzing data.
=> data is facts or pieces of info.


Statistics in data science involves the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.
It provides essential tools and methodologies for making sense of data, drawing conclusions, and making informed decisions.
Here are some key components of statistics in data science:

Descriptive Statistics: Summarize and describe the features of a dataset.

Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, median, and mode.
Measures of Dispersion: Range, variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range.
Data Visualization: Charts, graphs, and plots such as histograms, bar charts, box plots, and scatter plots.
Inferential Statistics: Make predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample of data.

Hypothesis Testing: Determine if there is enough evidence to support a specific hypothesis.
Confidence Intervals: Estimate the range within which a population parameter lies, based on sample statistics.
p-Values: Measure the strength of evidence against a null hypothesis.
Probability: Measure the likelihood of events and is foundational for inferential statistics.

Probability Distributions: Normal distribution, binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, etc.
Bayesian Statistics: Incorporate prior knowledge along with evidence to update the probability of a hypothesis.
Correlation and Causation: Analyze the relationship between variables.

Correlation Coefficient: Measure the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
Regression Analysis: Understand how the dependent variable changes with respect to one or more independent variables.
Sampling: Techniques to select a representative subset of data from a larger population.

Random Sampling: Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
Stratified Sampling: Population divided into subgroups (strata) and random samples taken from each strata.
Data Distribution: Understanding the distribution of data points in a dataset.

Normal Distribution: A bell-shaped distribution that is symmetrical about the mean.
Skewness and Kurtosis: Measure the asymmetry and the peakedness of the data distribution.
Experimental Design: Planning experiments to ensure that the data collected can provide valid and objective conclusions.

Randomized Controlled Trials: Participants randomly assigned to groups to test the effect of interventions.
Factorial Experiments: Study the effects of multiple factors simultaneously.
Statistics is fundamental in data science for making data-driven decisions, building models, and validating results.
 It helps data scientists to handle uncertainty, draw insights, and support conclusions with evidence from data.


                             TYPES OF STATATICS ::--

1) Descriptive statatics 
2) Inferential statatics

Statistics can be broadly categorized into two main types: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.
 Each type serves different purposes and employs different methodologies for analyzing data.

1. Descriptive Statistics ::-

    Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and organizing data so that it can be easily understood.
    This type of statistics focuses on presenting the data in a meaningful way.

    Key Components:
    Measures of Central Tendency: These describe the center or typical value of a dataset.

    Mean: The average of all data points.
    Median: The middle value when the data points are ordered.
    Mode: The most frequently occurring value.
    Measures of Dispersion: These describe the spread or variability in a dataset.

    Range: The difference between the highest and lowest values.
    Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean.
    Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance.
    Interquartile Range (IQR): The range within which the central 50% of the data lies (between the 25th and 75th percentiles).
    Data Visualization: Graphical representations of data to provide visual insights.

    Histograms: Show the frequency distribution of a dataset.
    Bar Charts: Compare quantities across different categories.
    Box Plots: Summarize data distribution with respect to the median, quartiles, and outliers.
    Scatter Plots: Show relationships between two numerical variables.

2. Inferential Statistics ::- 

    Inferential statistics involve methods for making inferences or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data.
    This type of statistics goes beyond the data at hand to draw conclusions about a larger group.

    Key Components:
    Hypothesis Testing: Assess the evidence in data to make decisions about a hypothesis.

    Null Hypothesis (H0): The hypothesis that there is no effect or no difference.
    Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The hypothesis that there is an effect or a difference.
    p-Value: Measures the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true.
    Confidence Intervals: Range of values within which the true population parameter is expected to lie,
     with a certain level of confidence (e.g., 95%).
    Estimation: Use sample data to estimate population parameters.

    Point Estimates: Single value estimates of a population parameter (e.g., sample mean).
    Interval Estimates: Range within which the parameter is expected to lie (e.g., confidence interval).
    Regression Analysis: Assess the relationship between variables.

    Simple Linear Regression: Analyze the relationship between two variables.
    Multiple Regression: Analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
    Correlation: Measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.

    Correlation Coefficient: A value between -1 and 1 indicating the degree of linear relationship between variables.
    Probability Distributions: Describe how probabilities are distributed over the values of a random variable.

    Normal Distribution: Bell-shaped distribution that is symmetric around the mean.
    Binomial Distribution: Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of binary (yes/no) trials.
    Poisson Distribution: Describes the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space.
    Other Types:
    Bayesian Statistics: Incorporate prior knowledge or beliefs in addition to the evidence from data to update
    the probability of a hypothesis.

    Non-parametric Statistics: Methods that do not assume a specific distribution for the data.
