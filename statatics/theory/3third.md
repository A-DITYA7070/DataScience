   Measure of Central tendency..

Measures of central tendency are statistical metrics that describe the center or typical value of a dataset.
They are commonly used in various fields such as economics, psychology, education, and business to summarize
data and draw inferences. Here are the primary measures of central tendency and their uses:

1. Mean (Average):
    Use: Best used with interval or ratio data that are symmetrically distributed without outliers.
    Example Applications:
    Calculating the average test score of a class.
    Determining the average income of a population.
    Finding the average temperature over a month.

2. Median:
    Use: Useful for ordinal data or interval/ratio data that are skewed or have outliers.
    Example Applications:
    Reporting the median household income to avoid the influence of extremely high or low incomes.
    Determining the median price of homes in a real estate market.
    Finding the median age of participants in a survey.

3. Mode:
Use: Best used with nominal data or to identify the most common category or value in a dataset.
Example Applications:
Identifying the most common shoe size sold in a store.
Determining the most frequent diagnosis in a medical dataset.
Finding the most popular color choice among consumers.
Each measure provides different insights and can be more appropriate depending on the nature of the
 data and the specific question being addressed.

Importance :-
 => median is used to find the central tendency when outliers are present.
 => Mean is used to find the central tendency when numerical data is present.
 => Mode is used to find the central tendency when catgeorical data is present.

NOTE:--

 when dealing with categorical feature we can use mode for missing values.
 when dealing with numerical feature we can use mean and median to fill the missing values.
