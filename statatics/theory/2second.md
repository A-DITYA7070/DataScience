  ===> Types of data :-

  In data science, data can generally be categorized into a few main types based on its nature and characteristics. Here are the primary types of data commonly encountered:

Numerical Data: Data represented by numbers and used for quantitative analysis. It can be further categorized into:

Discrete: Countable and finite (e.g., number of students).
Continuous: Infinite values within a range (e.g., temperature).
Categorical Data: Data that represents characteristics or qualities, and is typically non-numeric. Examples include:

Nominal: Categories without any natural order (e.g., colors, types of fruit).
Ordinal: Categories with a specific order or ranking (e.g., ratings from 1 to 5).
Text Data: Unstructured data represented by text, such as reviews, tweets, or articles. It requires natural language processing techniques for analysis.

Time Series Data: Data collected at regular intervals over time. Examples include stock prices, weather data, or sensor readings.

Spatial Data: Data that references physical locations or geographical areas. Examples include maps, GPS coordinates, or satellite imagery.

Image and Video Data: Data represented by visual information, used in fields like computer vision and image processing.

Graph Data: Data that represents relationships between entities. Examples include social networks, transportation networks, or citation networks.

Sensor Data: Data collected from sensors, often used in IoT (Internet of Things) applications for monitoring and control.
