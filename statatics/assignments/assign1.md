Q1. What is Statistics?
ans:- 
    Statistics in data science involves the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.
    It provides essential tools and methodologies for making sense of data, drawing conclusions, and making informed decisions.

Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used ?.
ans:- Types of statatics :-
  i) Descriptive statatics :- 
     Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and organizing data so that it can be easily understood.
     This type of statistics focuses on presenting the data in a meaningful way.

  ii) Inferential statatics :- 
    Inferential statistics involve methods for making inferences or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data.
    This type of statistics goes beyond the data at hand to draw conclusions about a larger group.

Q3. What are the different types of data and how do they differ from each other? Provide an example of
    each type of data ?.
ans:- 
   i) Quantitative data  :- type of data in which mathematical operations are possible
      These can be of two types:-
      a) Discrete :- means which is whole number and countable. ex:- 3 (no of children in a family.)
      b) Continuous :- means which is not whole number ex:- temprature,weight,height etc.
   ii) Qualitative data :- Type of data in which mathematical operations are not possible.
      These can be of two types:-
      a) nominal :- data which can not be ranked :- ex:- male/female,bloodgroup,pincode.
      b) ordinal :- data which can be ranked :- ex:- customer feedback.
    
Q4. Categorise the following datasets with respect to quantitative and qualitative data types:
(i) Grading in exam: A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E
(ii) Colour of mangoes: yellow, green, orange, red
(iii) Height data of a class: [178.9, 179, 179.5, 176, 177.2, 178.3, 175.8,...]
(iv) Number of mangoes exported by a farm: [500, 600, 478, 672, ...]
ans:- 
    quantitative :-
    i) Number of mangoes exported by a farm.
    qualitative :-
    i) grading in exam.
    ii) color of mangoes.
    iii) Height data of a class.

Q5. Explain the concept of levels of measurement and give an example of a variable for each level ?
ans :- 
    The concept of levels of measurement, also known as scales of measurement, refers to the different ways in which variables can be quantified and categorized. Understanding the level of measurement is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical techniques. There are four main levels of measurement:

    i)Nominal Level:
    Description: This is the most basic level of measurement, where data is categorized without any order or ranking. The categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.
    Example Variable: Types of fruits (e.g., apples, oranges, bananas).

    ii)Ordinal Level:
    Description: This level involves categories that can be ordered or ranked. However, the intervals between the ranks are not necessarily equal.
    Example Variable: Movie ratings (e.g., 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, 4 stars, 5 stars).
    iii) Interval Level:
    Description: This level includes ordered categories with equal intervals between them, but there is no true zero point. Arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction can be performed.
    Example Variable: Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit (e.g., 10°C, 20°C, 30°C).

   iv) Ratio Level:
    Description: This is the highest level of measurement, with ordered categories, equal intervals, and a true zero point. This allows for meaningful comparisons using ratios, and arithmetic operations like multiplication and division are possible.
    Example Variable: Weight (e.g., 50 kg, 75 kg, 100 kg).

Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an
    example to illustrate your answer.
ans:- 
    Understanding the level of measurement is crucial in data analysis because it dictates the types of statistical methods that can be applied and ensures that the analysis is valid and meaningful. Different levels of measurement require different analytical approaches, and using an inappropriate method can lead to incorrect conclusions. Here’s why it’s important:

    Appropriate Statistical Techniques: Different levels of measurement allow for different types of statistical tests. For instance, you can compute the mean for interval and ratio data, but not for nominal or ordinal data.
    Accuracy in Interpretation: Misinterpreting data by applying the wrong statistical methods can lead to inaccurate or misleading results. For example, applying parametric tests to ordinal data can be inappropriate because these tests assume equal intervals between data points.
    Data Integrity: Ensuring the correct level of measurement helps maintain the integrity and validity of the data analysis process.

Q7. How nominal data type is different from ordinal data type.
ans:- Nominal data type :- It is a part of qualitative data in which we can not give rank ex:- male/female, blood group, pincode.
      ordinal data type :- It is a part of qualitative data in which we can give rank ex:- customer feedback,movie rating etc.
    
Q8. Which type of plot can be used to display data in terms of range?
ans:- Box plot

Q9. Describe the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics. Give an example of each
    type of statistics and explain how they are used.
ans:- 
 i) Descriptive statatics :- 
     Descriptive statistics involve methods for summarizing and organizing data so that it can be easily understood.
     This type of statistics focuses on presenting the data in a meaningful way.

  ii) Inferential statatics :- 
    Inferential statistics involve methods for making inferences or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data.
    This type of statistics goes beyond the data at hand to draw conclusions about a larger group.

Q10. What are some common measures of central tendency and variability used in statistics? Explain
     how each measure can be used to describe a dataset.
ans:- commong measures of central tendency and variability are used to describe the characteristics of a dataset.
      Here are the key measures and how they are used:
      a) mean
      b) median
      c) mode
      d) range 
      e) standard deviation
