1. SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION.

Supervised Ml :-  a) Regression  --> Output or dependent feature --> Continuous
                  b) Classification --> Output or dependent feature --> Categorical



Problem :- we have two feature weight and height Train a model using the training dataset which should take weight as input and predict height as output 
==> since height is a continuous value hence it is a regression problem..

error :- The distance between actual and predicted point..

==> Goal of Simple Linear Regression is to find best fit line which is used for prediction...
==> We should select a best fit line such that the summation of all the errors should be minimal in the dataset..


Best fit line ==> (Y = mx+c)                                                                                                                      
                  H(x) = 0o + 01x1 (Here 0o is intercept which is the value of y axis when x=0)
                                   01 is slope or coefficient.
