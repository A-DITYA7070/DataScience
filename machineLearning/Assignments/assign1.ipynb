    "     a) Artificial Intelligence :- It is a science of developing smart machines that can think and act like human,using algorithm,data and \n",
    "                                   computational power to mimic human intelligence. A.I can be used in almost every field including Medicals,\n",
    "                                   Agriculture,Defence,Space,Construction etc, using different algorithms smart machines are built that can think\n",
    "                                   this is achieved by training the model.\n",

    "   b) Machine Learning :- Ml is a subset of a.i that is used to build complex machine that can perform complex task with little to no human interventions, it is used in prediction, like in price prediction, recommendation systems etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Ex of Ml :- facial recognition, product recomendations,finanicial accuracy,social media optimisaiton, predictive analytic.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Deep learning :- Dl is a type of ai that teaches computers to process data like the human brain. DL models can identify complex patterns in pictures,sounds,texts and other data to make accurate predictions and insights. DL is a subset of ml, which uses algos to learn from the data and make decisions. DL structures algos in layers to create an artificial neural network that can make decisions on its own."
