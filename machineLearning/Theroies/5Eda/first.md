<!-- EDA (Exploratory data anaysis..) -->

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. Here are the key aspects of EDA:

    Understanding the Data: This involves getting familiar with the structure, content, and key features of the data. You start by looking at the data types, missing values, and basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.

    Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing values, outliers, and errors in the dataset. This may include imputing missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.

    Visual Analysis: Creating various plots and charts to visualize the data. Common visualizations include histograms, box plots, scatter plots, bar charts, and line plots. These help in understanding the distribution of data, relationships between variables, and detecting patterns or anomalies.

    Univariate Analysis: Analyzing each variable individually to understand its distribution and main features. This often involves looking at the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the distribution.

    Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Exploring the relationships between two or more variables. This includes correlation analysis, cross-tabulations, and scatter plot matrices to identify potential associations and interactions between variables.

    Hypothesis Testing: Formulating and testing hypotheses about the data. This might involve statistical tests to compare groups, assess relationships, and make inferences.

    Summary and Interpretation: Summarizing the key findings from the data analysis. This helps in drawing conclusions and making informed decisions based on the data insights.

EDA is crucial because it helps in uncovering underlying patterns, spotting anomalies, testing assumptions, and validating models. It forms the foundation for further data analysis, model building, and decision-making processes


TYPES OF EDA ::---

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can be categorized into several types based on the techniques and methods used. Here are the main types of EDA:

    Univariate Analysis: This focuses on analyzing a single variable at a time. It helps in understanding the distribution, central tendency, and dispersion of the variable. Common techniques include:
        Descriptive statistics: Mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range, etc.
        Visualizations: Histograms, box plots, density plots, bar charts, and pie charts. 

    Bivariate Analysis: This involves the analysis of two variables to understand the relationship between them. Techniques include:
        Descriptive statistics: Correlation coefficient, covariance.
        Visualizations: Scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps.

    Multivariate Analysis: This deals with the analysis of more than two variables simultaneously. It helps in understanding the interactions and relationships among multiple variables. Techniques include:
        Descriptive statistics: Multivariate correlations, principal component analysis (PCA).
        Visualizations: Pair plots, scatter plot matrices, 3D scatter plots, parallel coordinates plots, and heatmaps.

    Dimensionality Reduction: This is used to reduce the number of variables under consideration and can be useful in visualizing data in lower dimensions. Techniques include:
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
        Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

    Cluster Analysis: This involves grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (or cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Techniques include:
        K-means clustering
        Hierarchical clustering
        DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

    Time Series Analysis: This is used when dealing with time-dependent data. It involves analyzing the data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. Techniques include:
        Descriptive statistics: Trends, seasonality, cyclic patterns.
        Visualizations: Line plots, seasonal plots, autocorrelation plots.
