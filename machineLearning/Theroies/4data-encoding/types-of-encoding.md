1. Nominal or ONE HOT ENCODING (OHE) :- 
It is a techinque used to transform categorical variable that have no intrinsic ordering into numerical values
that can be used in machine learning models. One common method for nominal encoding is one-hot-encoding, which
creates a binary vector for each category in the variable.

Disadvantage :-
1) it creates sparse matrix leading to overfitting.
2) If you have many number of ctageories it increases the features and as the no of feature increases performance of model descreases.
