<!-- Performance measure used in Regression -->

1) R Squared.
2) Adjusted R Squared.

1) R squared =  1 - SSres/SStotal   (SSres = sum of squared residual {error})
                                    (SStotal = sum of square total)


2) Adjusted R squared =  1 - ((1 - R*R)(N-1))/(N - P - 1)
                         
                         N = total no of data points.
                         R*R = R squared.
                         P = no of independent data points.

Note:- Adjusted R-squared is always less than R-squared..
