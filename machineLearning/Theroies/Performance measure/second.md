1) Mean Squared Error. (MSE)
2) Mean Absolute Error. (MAE)
3) Root mean Squared Error. (RMSE)


1) MSE is same root mean squared error i.e MSE = 1/n (summation of 1 to n)(Yi-Y'i)2

Advantage :- 
i) Due to quadratic equation the equation is differentiable.
ii) It has only one local/global minimum.

Disadvantage :-
i) It is not robust to outliers.
ii) It is not in the same unit.

2) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) :-

MAE = 1/n (summation of 1 to n) (Yi - Y'i)
Advantage :- 
i) Robust to outliers
ii) it will be in the same unit..

Disadvantage :- 
i) Convergence takes more time.

3) RMSE (Root mean squared error):-

RMSE = Root(MSE)
Advantage :-
i) Same unit.
ii) Differentiable.

Diadvantage :-
i) Not robust to outliers...

Note ::--

i) Performance metrics :- R2 & Adjusted R2 (Accuracy of the model).
ii) Cost function :- Error -> MAE,MSE,RMSE
