==>>   Handling imbalanced datasets :- handling imbalanced datasets is neccessary because it can lead to false positives leading to wrong pridiction.

methods to handle imbalanced datasets :--
i) Upsampling
ii) Downsampling

i) upsampling :- It is the method of increasing the datasets of minority class, this can be done by creating artificial points that are similar to the existing data.
ii) Dowsampling :- It is the method of decreasing the datasets of majority class, this can be done by randomly removing observations from the majority class to prevent its signal from dominating the learning algorithm,
                   It can help correct imbalanced data and improve model performance.
