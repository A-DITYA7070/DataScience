TYPES OF ML.

1. Supervised ml :- a) classification :- categorical features
                    b) Regression :- continuous features.

                 :- Dataset - we know the output feature of dataset.
                 => classification
                   no of hours      no of study hrs    pass/fail
                   8                2                  fail
                   7                3                  fail
                   6                5                  pass

                Here output feature is dependent and we know it prior.

                => Regression :-
                   Here output feature is continuous.
                   size_of_house      No_of_room      Price_Of_The_House
                   1000               3                1000000
                   2000               4                2000000
                   3000               5                3000000
                   4000               6                4000000

                Here the output feature is continuous


2. Unsupervised learning :-

              Ex:- customer segmentation.

3. semi-supervised :- supervised + unsupervised.

4. Reinforcement Learning :- A.i agents try to learn through envirnoment and get reward when they do well.
